# About Me
Mission-driven undergraduate student researcher at Stony Brook University, motivated to pursue challenging, high-impact problems across a rich spectrum of AI topics. I am grateful to be currently advised by [Dr. Chenyu You](http://chenyuyou.me/), whose mentorship fuels this journey, and to have been previously guided by [Dr. Keze Wang](https://kezewang.com/) and [Dr. Hejun Wu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/WuHejun) during two formative years at Sun Yat-sen University’s HCP Lab—a foundation that keeps me exploring widely and actively seeking new collaborations.
